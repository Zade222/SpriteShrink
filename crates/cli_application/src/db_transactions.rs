//! Manages all database transactions for the CLI application.
//!
//! This module provides a high-level API for interacting with the temporary
//! `redb` database used during the compression process. It abstracts away the
//! complexities of database connections, table management, and read/write
//! transactions. All functions are designed to be robust and provide clear
//! error handling, ensuring data consistency and integrity.

/// Inserts multiple key-value pairs into the database in a single transaction.
///
/// This function is designed for efficient bulk data insertion. It takes a
/// vector of key-value tuples (representing chunk hashes and their data) and
/// writes them to the database within a single write transaction. To support
/// data deduplication, it checks for the existence of each key before
/// inserting, avoiding redundant writes if a key is already present.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `db_info`: A `DBInfo` struct containing the database connection and table
///   definition.
/// * `items`: A `Vec` where each element is a tuple containing the key (`H`)
///   and its corresponding data (`Vec<u8>`).
///
/// # Returns
///
/// A `Result` which is:
/// - `Ok(())` if the batch insertion is completed successfully.
/// - `Err(CliError)` if any database operation fails during the transaction.
///
/// # Type Parameters
///
/// * `H`: The generic hash type, which must implement the traits required for
///   use as a `redb` database key.
